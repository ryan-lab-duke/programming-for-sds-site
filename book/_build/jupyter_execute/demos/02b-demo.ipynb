    "In Week 1, we added some headings and formatted our text as **Markdown** to produce notebook submissions that were stuctured and tidy. Sometimes it is also nice to format the **numerical output** returned by a Python cell in a readable way. For example, we may want to change the number of decimal places. In this demo, we demonstrate some useful approaches for formatting your numerical answers."
